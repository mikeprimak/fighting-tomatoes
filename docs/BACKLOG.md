# Good Fights — Master Backlog

**Created:** 2026-06-21 · **Owner:** Mike · **Status:** living doc

This is the single running list of everything queued. Each item has an **effort tag**, a **status** (grounded by a 2026-06-21 codebase audit), and notes. Check items off as they ship and log the work in `docs/daily/`.

**Effort tags:** `S` = under ~1hr · `M` = one session · `L` = multi-session · `XL` = multi-week / big feature
**Status:** `🟢 ready` (scoped, just do it) · `🟡 needs design` (decision/brainstorm first) · `🔵 needs Mike` (external/asset/decision blocker) · `⚪ idea` (not committed)

---

## ⭐ How to approach this (read first)

The list is ~70 items. Don't go top-to-bottom — that thrashes between contexts. Instead work in **themed batches** so you stay in one mental area and one part of the code per session. Recommended order is in **§ Sequencing** at the bottom. The single most leveraged cluster is **Notifications** (a half-built system with an orphaned DB table) — fixing it well moves retention more than anything else here.

Keep the **User-Focused Pivot** work in its own branch/folder (`C:\Users\avoca\fight-mobile-app-pivot`, branch `claude/user-focused-pivot-l8l6mg`) — never mix it into main-branch sessions.

---

## 1. Quick wins (high impact ÷ low effort — do these first)

These are scoped, isolated, and mostly `S`/`M`. Knock them out in one or two sessions to clear noise.

- [x] `S` 🔵 **Admin alert email** → DONE by Mike (Render env var `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` → `contact@goodfights.app`).
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Roundtree Jr. name parse bug** → DONE on branch `backlog/round-1-quick-wins`. Root cause: `scrapeAllUFCData.js:174` built the event title via `.split(' ').pop()` (grabs the "Jr." suffix). Replaced with a suffix-aware surname helper (keeps "Rountree Jr."). `parseFighterName()` was already correct. **Follow-up: one-off DB rename** of the existing "UFC Fight Night Ankalaev vs. Jr." row + audit matchroom/tapology live parsers that use the same `.pop()` for winner-matching.
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Event descriptions too long** → DONE. `extractFightEnrichment.ts` SYSTEM_PROMPT now: exactly ONE sentence (~15-25 words) + hard "never mention venue/city/country" rule (per Mike — stick to fighter style + storylines). New events pick it up; optionally re-run enrichment on recent ones.
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Fighter "About" → collapse behind "see more"** → DONE on mobile (`app/fighter/[id].tsx`, tldr visible + See more/less toggle) and web (`FighterDetailClient.tsx`, native `<details>` so the body stays in the DOM for SEO).
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Home screen copy** → DONE. (a) follow explainer added as the "Most Followed" section subtitle; (b) "Top Comments" → "Comments on recent fights".
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Remove redundant "…" menu** → DONE (2026-06-22, merge `f46c5d25`) together with the §3 rating/hype item. `FightDetailsMenu.tsx` deleted; its fighter/event links + weight-class/date were already on the detail screen.
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Admin: confirm scraper health** → DONE (2026-06-22, merge on `main`). The "dead Scrapfly path" was a per-workflow ENV issue, not a `tapologyBrowser.js` code issue (the launcher is fully env-driven now). Karate Combat (the only **unshelved** one of the four) was silently extracting 0 fights daily — GH reported "success" because the scraper fail-closes + exits 0. Swapped `SCRAPFLY_KEY` → `TAPOLOGY_PROXY` + `CAPSOLVER_KEY` (the working dirty-boxing/mvp/gamebred recipe) in **karate-combat** + the 3 shelved tapology scrapers (toprank/goldenboy/goldstar) + zuffa-boxing. **Verified** via a manual KC dispatch: CapSolver cleared the Turnstile through the residential proxy → pulled KC 61 (9 fights) + KC 62 (Jul 24, UPCOMING, 4 fights), 25 fighters imported. Top Rank/Golden Boy/Gold Star/Zuffa are **shelved** (scheduled runs skip) — env fixed so manual dispatch + future un-shelving work. (`tapology-live-tracker.yml` = legacy-on-GH, runs on VPS; `tapology-backfill.yml` = VPS cron — both left as-is.)

---

## 2. Notifications (the highest-leverage cluster)

**Audit finding:** A `UserNotification` table already exists in the schema (`schema.prisma:1084-1117`) **but is orphaned** — nothing writes to it, no API reads it, no screen shows it. Notifications are pushed via Expo and forgotten. Defaults are all-on. Aggregation is per-event only. Permission-check-on-enable already exists and is well done.

- [x] `L` 🟢 **Notification Center (in-app history)** → DONE on branch `backlog/round-2-notifications`. (1) `sendPushNotifications` persists a `UserNotification` row per recipient when `payload.persist` is set; opted in at follow-fighter lanes (booked/3-day/morning), walkout, section-start. (2) `GET /api/notifications` (last 7d + unreadCount), `GET /unread-count`, `POST /mark-read`. (3) `app/notifications.tsx` screen + envelope icon w/ unread badge in `TabBar` (between search + profile) + a Profile row.
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Reduce default notifications; default = walkouts only** → DONE. `schema.prisma` defaults for booked/3-day/morning flipped to `false` (walkout stays `true`) via `ALTER COLUMN SET DEFAULT` migration — new signups only, existing users untouched.
- [ ] `M` 🟡 **Cross-event weekend aggregation** → **DEFERRED (needs design).** Today each event sends its own "N fighters fighting this weekend" (so UFC + RAF = two pushes — *by design*, in `followFighterNotifications.ts:472`). Add a cross-event weekend digest that rolls all of a user's followed fighters across the weekend into ONE message. Needs a small design decision (digest cadence vs per-event fallback — see `followup_notif_double_fire_suppression`).
- [ ] `M` 🟢 **"Casual / Big Events Only" tier** → **DEFERRED.** No tier exists today. Add a preset that maps to rule conditions (e.g. only numbered/PPV events, higher hype floor). Surface in settings. (Left for a follow-up — larger rule-condition work, lower urgency than the anchor.)
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Silence for 8 hours** → DONE. New `users.notificationsSnoozedUntil` column; `sendPushNotifications` excludes future-snoozed users centrally; `POST /api/notifications/snooze {hours}` (0 clears); snooze bar on the Notifications screen.
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Permission-off warning when enabling a fight notif** → VERIFIED, no change needed. The only ACTIVE enable surfaces (live-fight follow in `LiveFightCard`, fighter follow in `FollowFighterButton`) both call `ensurePushPermissionAfterAction`. The upcoming-fight bell is a disabled indicator and the `FightDetailsMenu` notify toggle is `false &&`-gated, so there's no uncovered surface.
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Remove the hidden toggles** → DONE. Deleted `notifyHypedFights` + `notifyPreEventReport` from the preferences schema/API + `manageHypedFightsRule` helper + mobile `settings.tsx` dead state. Pre-event-report send path + rules left intact; no prod data mutated.

## 3. Mobile app polish

- [x] `S` 🟢 **Android notification tray icon** → DONE (2026-06-22, `f112c5c1`). **Root cause of the "switched back" mystery:** the bare `android/` dir ships committed `drawable-*/notification_icon.png` that override `app.json`'s `expo-notifications` icon (prebuild only regenerates them; a bare-`android` eas build skips prebuild). Old drawables + managed asset were a 227KB full raster → Android masks it to a white blob. Regenerated all 5 density drawables **and** the 96px managed asset from Mike's `THICKER-GOOD-FIGHTS-LOGO-WHITE-ALPHA.png` (trimmed + ~86% fill) via sharp, so both the committed-drawable and prebuild paths now yield the white glove. **Needs a new Android build to reach users** (native drawables aren't OTA-able).
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Profile image on mobile = MISSING** → DONE (2026-06-22, merge `d478af67`). Added avatar picker UI to `app/edit-profile.tsx` (expo-image-picker, already in the native build → OTA-safe), upload → `updateProfile({avatar})` → refresh. **Also fixed the root cause for web:** `/upload/profile-image` was writing to Render's ephemeral disk + returning a RELATIVE url (resolved against goodfights.app → 404) — now uploads to R2 and returns an absolute url.
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Put rating/hype/prediction on the fight detail screen** → DONE (2026-06-22, merge `f46c5d25`). Mike was right — `handleHypeSelection` existed but was wired to no UI, so the detail screen showed only crowd stats. Added a **"Your Hype"** card (Upcoming) / **"Your Rating"** card (Completed) showing the user's value (or a prompt), tapping opens `UpcomingFightModal`/`CompletedFightModal` in place (invalidates `['fight', id]` on close to refresh). Hid the modals' "See Comments" link when opened from the detail screen (`hideSeeComments` prop) so it doesn't stack another copy. **Removed the redundant "…" `FightDetailsMenu`** (header trigger + both render sites + deleted the 399-line component; fighter/event/weight-class/date are all already on-screen). Mobile-only OTA; not device-tested yet.
- [ ] `S` 🟢 **Test biometric login** → shipped 2026-06-01 but never device-tested. Needs a real device + the native build.

## 4. Web app

- [x] `M` 🟢 **Profile image broken on web "Edit Profile"** → DONE (2026-06-22, merge `d478af67`). Root cause exactly as suspected: the endpoint returned a relative `/uploads/...` URL that resolved against goodfights.app (404), AND the page never persisted the avatar (only in-memory `setUser`). Fixed at the backend (R2 + absolute URL) + web now persists via `updateProfile({avatar})` + uploading spinner.
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Live tab auto-update (web)** → DONE (2026-06-22). `events/live/page.tsx` polled `['events','live']` at a flat 60s. Made `refetchInterval` a function: **15s while any event is live** (matches event-detail's live cadence so results/up-next refresh without reload), **60s otherwise** (no backend hammering when nothing's on). Cards re-render automatically — `EventCard`/`FightSectionList` render from the polled `data.events` props.

## 5. Search

- [ ] `M` 🟢 **Typeahead / predictive search** → both platforms are search-on-submit, no debounce, no suggestions. Add a debounced typeahead dropdown (fighters/events/fights) on web `Navbar.tsx` + mobile `SearchBar.tsx`, reusing the existing `/search` endpoint (may need a lightweight `limit`-capped suggest mode).
- [ ] `S` 🟢 **General search QA** → people actually use search; do a pass on relevance/ranking on both platforms.

## 6. Scrapers & data

- [~] `M` 🟢 **Scrapers should capture odds** → **UFC DONE (2026-06-22).** ufc.com renders American moneyline odds next to each corner (`.c-listing-fight__odds-amount`); the scraper already captured them into the JSON but `ufcDataParser.ts` was dropping them on import. Now maps `fighterA/B.odds` → `fighter1Odds`/`fighter2Odds` (new `normalizeOdds()` filters the "-" no-line placeholder + junk to null; only writes when present so a late "-" doesn't wipe a captured line; odds stay paired with the right corner through `upsertFightSwapAware`'s reorder). **Remaining:** (1) other daily scrapers (BKFC/Tapology orgs/etc. — check if their source pages expose odds), (2) the original "The Odds API consensus" idea is now optional — only needed for orgs whose scrape source lacks odds, or to enrich UFC with a consensus line. (3) No odds-on-card UI yet (fields populate silently — future UI work).
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Broadcast: not all MVP events are Netflix** → DONE (2026-06-22). Audit finding: **no MVP event currently mis-reads Netflix** — MVP has zero `PromotionBroadcastDefault` rows (per-card by design), so events with no `EventBroadcast` rows render empty, not Netflix. Only Rousey vs. Carano reads Netflix (correct — it *was* the Netflix card). The real gap was the genuinely-scheduled upcoming **MVPW 5: Johnson vs. Thorslund (Aug 8)** showing NO broadcaster. Added per-event rows (US ESPN/ESPN App, GB Sky Sports, CA/EU/AU/NZ DAZN — sourced from MVP/ESPN/Sky announcements) to `seed-mvp-broadcasts.ts` + applied to prod. MVPW 6 left (placeholder 2099 date, broadcaster unannounced).
- [x] `S` 🟢 **RAF broadcast channel** → DONE (already live in prod; 2026-06-22 reconciled the seed files). Prod already had RAF US → Fox Nation **and** RAF CA/AU/EU/GB/NZ → `raf-youtube` (FREE, RAF's own `@RAFwrestling` channel) — *more* complete than this item asked. The two seed scripts were stale (only listed RAF US fox-nation); added the `raf-youtube` channel to `seed-broadcast-channels.ts` + the RAF YouTube rows to `seed-promotion-defaults.ts` so the repo matches prod. No prod data change needed.
- [ ] `M` 🟡 **Broadcast discovery: auto-accept, no manual review** → **Mike: kill the manual-review step.** Today `broadcastDiscovery/run.ts` surfaces NEW/CHANGED findings for admin triage. Redesign so high-confidence findings (above a tuned confidence threshold) are written directly to `PromotionBroadcastDefault` with no human in the loop; only low-confidence ones (if any) queue for review. Pick the threshold conservatively to avoid bad auto-writes.
- [x] `M` 🟡 **Harden the other 12 unguarded importers** → DONE (2026-06-22, merge `c0ee3bef`). Applied the per-tier decision. **SKIP tier** (graceful return, karateCombat/raf/dirtyBoxing idiom — small/intermittent/seasonal/shelved promos where empty is benign): mvp, gamebred, matchroom, oktagon, goldenBoy, goldStar, rizin, topRank, **pfl** (seasonal off-season gaps). **ALERT tier** (clear actionable thrown error instead of a raw ENOENT — still fails the run + pages, *intended*, since zero events = scrape failure): **ufc, bkfc, oneFC** (year-round high-frequency, never legitimately empty). Backend prod tsc exit 0. All 15 importers now guarded.
- [x] `S` 🟢 **Confirm start-time AI system is live** → DONE (2026-06-22). Verified live: most recent discovery attempt **today** (BKFC Liberty Brawl, 17:27 UTC), 8 attempts in the last 7 days, 6 events carry applied discovery times with full provenance (`startTimeSource='discovery'` + `startTimeConfidence` 0.75–0.92 + `startTimeSourceUrls`). Read-only check committed at `scripts/verify-starttime-discovery.ts`. Minor note: a few imminent non-shelved events (OKTAGON Tipsport 06-24, ONE FF160 06-26, PFL San Diego 06-27) show `lastTry=never` — likely imported after the last daily cycle; next cycle should pick them up (retry/window logic). Worth a glance next data session if they stay unresolved.
- [x] `M` 🟢 **Fighter image auto-refresh on belt/status changes** → DONE (2026-06-22, UFC). New daily job `src/scripts/refreshRecentUFCHeadshots.ts` + `.github/workflows/ufc-headshot-refresh.yml` (14:00 UTC, separated from the 17:00 scrape). Re-pulls headshots for every fighter who fought a **UFC card that COMPLETED in the last 10 days** (rolling window, no schema migration — scoped via `eventStatus='COMPLETED'` + `scraperType='ufc'` + `mainStartTime`) and **overwrites on change**, unlike the null-only quarterly backfill. Change detection is free: R2 keys on `md5(sourceUrl)`, so a new UFC asset path → new R2 url → write; unchanged photo → identical url → skip (page fetch only, R2 download only when the photo actually changed). Safety: aborts if R2 unconfigured (no downgrade to raw urls), never replaces a real photo with a silhouette, keeps the og:title trust-check, optimistic-concurrency write. **Verified end-to-end (dry-run):** Derrick Lewis correctly flagged changed (`LEWIS_DERRICK_06-14.png` → new hash) — the exact case the backfill missed. **UFC-only for now** (only source with a headshot fetcher); other orgs deferred.

## 7. Ratings, hype & events-as-a-whole

- [ ] `L` 🟡 **Shareable card from the post-hype / post-rate modal (virality play)** → **NEW (2026-06-24).** Today, after a user hypes or rates a fight in the app, they see a post-hype modal / post-rating modal. **Convert that post-modal into a shareable card.** The card summarizes their action in a clean, branded graphic, e.g. *"I'm hyped for this fight: 8/10. Backing [Fighter B]. '[their comment]'"* (rating variant: *"I rated this fight X/10…"*), with a **"Share?"** CTA that uses the **native share sheet** (text-message chats, Instagram, X, etc.). Mobile: native share via `expo-sharing` / RN `Share`, rendering the card to an image (view-shot) for image-based shares. **Web parity:** add the same shareability on the web app — **NOTE the web app does NOT have post-hype / post-rate modals yet**, so web needs (a) the post-action modals built first, then (b) the shareable card + Web Share API / copy-link fallback. Each shared card should carry brand watermark + a deep link back to the fight (drives installs / web traffic — ties into the SEO/growth thesis). Aligns with the pivot's "sharable card" idea (§11) but for the mainstream hype/rate flow, not onboarding. Voice of the modals (§10) should land before/with this.

- [ ] `L` 🟡 **Event-level hype & rating (better algo)** — Mike wants help designing this. `Event.averageRating`/`totalRatings` fields exist but the legacy avg-of-all-ratings is crude (one hot fight skews a card). **Needs a design session** — see `§ Decisions` for algo options to react to.
- [ ] `M` 🟡 **Comment section improvements:**
  - Link on a post-fight comment → user's pre-fight comment (no pre/post link exists today; `PreFightComment` and `FightReview` are separate tables).
  - New comments start self-upvoted (1, not 0) — *audit says this already happens for top-level comments* (`UpcomingFightDetailScreen.tsx:619`); verify + extend to replies if wanted.
  - Allow deleting pre-fight comments after the fight (delete logic exists; confirm it's reachable post-completion).
- [ ] `M` 🟢 **Comment edit/delete bug** → deleting on the details screen still shows in the modal; "Done" doesn't resave; re-editing opens an empty textarea. Modal vs details-screen state diverge — reproduce and fix the shared state in `UpcomingFightDetailScreen.tsx` / `CompletedFightDetailScreen.tsx`.

## 8. Back catalog / legacy data

- [~] `L` 🟢 **Legacy event order (~hundreds)** → main-event-shows-as-first-prelim. **Phase 1 audit + phase 2 fix of the safe set DONE 2026-06-22.** `audit-legacy-event-order.ts` (read-only) scores each legacy event with an authoritative **name-match** signal (UFC cards are named after the main event) + title + weak rating — not the rating heuristic alone the memory warns about. Of 1130 scored: **225 safe-to-fix** (211 `INVERTED-HIGH` + 14 `INVERTED-STRUCTURAL`), 325 `INVERTED-RATING-ONLY`, 30 `SENTINEL`, 341 already-correct. **Fixed all 225 on prod** via `fix-legacy-event-order.ts --apply` (self-inverse `newOrder=(min+max)−old`, single set-based UPDATE; 2491 rows; post-fix all 225 re-classify `CORRECT`, spot-check confirmed main event now at order 1). Reports in `docs/audits/legacy-order-audit.{md,csv}`. **Remaining:** the 325 rating-only + 30 sentinel need an authoritative external source (ufcstats/Wikipedia). See `lesson_legacy_event_order_inversion`.
- [ ] `M` 🟢 **Missing UFC banner images on historic events** → audit which legacy events lack a banner, backfill from a source.

## 9. Editorial / articles / marketing content

> **⭐ STRATEGIC DIRECTION (2026-06-24): we are going HARD on the SEO play.** The thesis: publish a steady stream of **SEO-targeted blog articles** that, over time, **cumulatively build organic web traffic and compound the asset's value.** Every editorial item below should be evaluated through this lens — pick topics with real search demand, structure each post for SEO (title/H1, meta description, internal links via the hub+cluster model, schema/structured data, clean slugs), and treat publishing cadence as the lever. This compounds: each article is a permanent traffic-earning asset, and the back catalog grows month over month. Source of truth for the mechanics: `docs/playbooks/seo-fight-preview-cluster.md` ([[project_seo_fight_preview_playbook]]). Track organic-visitors/mo in the admin Acquisition tab ([[project_web_traffic_acquisition_metric]]). Don't chase one-off viral posts at the expense of the evergreen, search-targeted back catalog.

- [ ] `M` 🟢 **Continue "Placement on the Card Rankings" article** → in active iteration (4 drafts as of 2026-06-23, see `docs/daily/2026-06-23.md`). Newest canonical candidate: `docs/marketing/card-placement-rankings-article-v3-ppv-split.md` (avg-card-slot scale, PPV vs Fight Night split, activity gate, richer fighter stories, em-dash-free). **Open before publish:** (1) confirm which draft becomes canonical + delete the 2 dead drafts (`...-v2-position.md`, the single-list "editing version"); (2) convert to a real blog post (`packages/web/src/content/posts/*.md`, `draft: true`, run `syncBlogPosts.js`, deploy → shows in admin Blog > Drafts); (3) make it a flagship **SEO** piece per the strategic direction above (search-targeted title/slug, internal links, structured for organic discovery). Scripts behind it are read-only analysis tools in `packages/backend/scripts/`.
- [ ] `M` 🔵 **Conor "Fights Rated" article** → polish, embed images properly, fix existing images, add spoiler warning.
- [ ] `L` 🔵 **Ruleset comparison infographic** → continue refinement (many `ruleset-comparison-v*` versions exist in `docs/marketing/infographics/`).
- [ ] `M` 🔵 **Conor infographic** → complete.
- [ ] `M` ⚪ **"What makes a good fight?" infographic** → finish + publish as a blog post.
- [ ] `S` ⚪ **Gaethje/Rogan article** → Mike noted "do nothing?" — likely already done. Confirm + close.
- [ ] `S` ⚪ **Article idea:** Conor's best insults of every fighter.
- [ ] `S` ⚪ **Poll idea:** favorite MMA YouTube channels.
- [ ] `L` 🟢 **Weekly Monday email recap** → community scores from the weekend, top-rated moments, biggest upsets vs pre-fight hype, week-ahead preview. Mostly auto-generated from existing data via Resend Broadcasts. High-leverage retention/marketing artifact.

## 10. Voice of the app

- [ ] `M` 🔵 **Apply voice guide** → there's a VOICE chat + a voice-guide doc on Mike's Desktop. **Mike must share both** before this can start. Then update post-rating + post-hype modals, and error/empty states.

## 11. User-Focused Pivot ⚠️ (separate branch/folder)

> Work ONLY in `C:\Users\avoca\fight-mobile-app-pivot`, branch `claude/user-focused-pivot-l8l6mg`. Dev user: `testdev+onb0612@goodfights.app` / `Testpass1!`. Never fold into main.

- [ ] `XL` 🟡 **Finish onboarding**, then surface insights/cards/home-screen.
- [ ] ⚪ Data capture: flag if a user rated **live** (within 4hr of event end).
- [ ] ⚪ Sharable card — one clear message; define user *as* a fighter type ("Grappler", not "Grappler watcher").
- [ ] ⚪ Onboarding quiz ("first fight you remember caring about?", fav fighter then/now…).
- [ ] ⚪ "Is there a fight this weekend I might like?" pattern-matching.
- [ ] ⚪ Specific fight recommendations post-onboarding ("you might like Rockhold vs Bisping because…").
- [ ] ⚪ "Watch later" list feature.

## 12. Winner prediction / "Who do you support?"

- [ ] `L` 🟡 **"WHO DO YOU SUPPORT?" feature set** → already reframed from predictions to *allegiance* (`project_rooting_for_pivot`). Work continues on branch `winner-predictions`. Comms must defuse the trained predict-reflex.

## 13. Infrastructure & technical debt

- [ ] `L` 🔵 **Offsite backup redundancy** → codebase + DB + assets (R2). Needs a plan: where (provider), cadence, restore test. Codebase is on GitHub already; DB + R2 are the real gap.
- [ ] `M` 🟢 **Remove all seed-data code** → fully delete seed data + remnants.
- [ ] `M` 🟡 **Baseline typecheck errors** → decide policy. Current gate is "0 NEW errors" over an 84-error baseline (`feedback_multi_window_release_coordination`). Worth a cleanup pass but not urgent.
- [ ] `M` 🟢 **Scheduled fighter enrichment must not overwrite good profiles** → `aiProfileSource` provenance exists (`project_fighter_profile_provenance`); ensure the cron respects it and never clobbers hand-authored/Opus bios.

## 14. Security

- [ ] `L` 🟡 **CAPTCHA / abuse prevention** → on signup + comment/rating write paths. (Vercel BotID is an option for web; mobile needs its own approach.)
- [ ] `L` 🔵 **General security audit** → scope it: auth/token handling, rate limiting, input validation, R2 bucket perms, admin-panel access. Can run the `/security-review` skill on key surfaces.

## 15. Monetization

- [ ] `M` 🟢 **Affiliate links on ALL "How to Watch" links** + click tracking. **STRATEGIC (2026-06-24): this is now an active revenue play — we're going to start making money as an affiliate.** Wrap every "How to Watch" / broadcaster link (mobile + web + any blog/editorial "where to watch" CTA) in an affiliate/referral URL where the broadcaster or streaming partner has an affiliate program (DAZN, ESPN+, Sky, FITE/Triller, Amazon Prime, etc.), with UTM + click tracking so we can attribute conversions. Audit every surface that renders a broadcaster link today (`EventBroadcast` / `PromotionBroadcastDefault` render sites on mobile + web, plus editorial), centralize the affiliate-wrap so a single map of `channelId → affiliate template` covers all of them, and log clicks for attribution. Sign up for the relevant affiliate programs (Mike-driven where an application is required).

## 16. Admin panel

- [ ] `M` 🟡 **Admin deep-dive** → audit the app + admin panel, propose new controls (emergency handling, manual overrides, ops levers Mike will want at scale).

## 17. Brand / legal

- [ ] `XL` 🔵 **Canadian IP lawyer** → trademark/IP protection. External, Mike-driven.
- [ ] `M` 🔵 **App Store preview video** → ASC rejected it (wrong phone size). Re-record on a borrowed modern iPhone.

---

## Decisions needed from Mike (unblock these)

1. **Event score algo** (§7) — react to the options below.
2. **Voice guide** (§10) — share the Desktop doc + VOICE chat.
3. **Backup plan** (§13) — pick a provider/budget for offsite DB + R2.
4. **App Store video** (§17) — borrow an iPhone.
5. **IP lawyer** (§17) — external engagement.
6. **Odds in app** (§6) — confirm we want fight odds app-wide (cost: The Odds API tier), not just blog graphics.

### Event-score algo — options to react to (for §7)

The legacy "average of all fight ratings" over-weights one hot fight on an otherwise dead card. Better candidates:
- **Confidence-weighted mean** (Bayesian shrinkage): pull a card's average toward the global mean until it has enough ratings, so a 1-rating card can't top the charts.
- **Depth-aware score**: reward cards where *multiple* fights cleared a "good fight" bar (e.g. count of fights rated ≥ X), not just the single peak — captures "stacked card" feel.
- **Peak + floor blend**: `α·(best fight) + β·(median fight)` so both the headliner banger and overall quality matter.
- **Upset/surprise bonus** (past events): reward cards where results diverged from pre-fight hype.
- For **upcoming events**, "will it be good?" = aggregate *hype* with the same shrinkage, plus a stylistic-matchup signal from AI enrichment.

---

## Recommended sequencing

1. **Sprint 1 — Quick wins (§1).** One or two sessions. Clears 7 isolated items, several user-visible.
2. **Sprint 2 — Notifications (§2).** The Notification Center + default reduction + snooze. Biggest retention lever; one coherent code area.
3. **Sprint 3 — Scrapers/data correctness (§6) + back catalog audit (§8).** Batch all data-layer work together while in that headspace.
4. **Sprint 4 — Mobile/web parity polish (§3, §4, §5).** Profile image (mobile), web home live-update, typeahead.
5. **Sprint 5 — Comments + fight-detail (§7 comment items).** One UI area.
6. **Parallel track — Editorial/marketing (§9).** Interleave on fight weeks; the weekly email is the standout.
7. **Separate track — User-Focused Pivot (§11).** Its own branch/folder, never mixed in.
8. **Design-first, schedule when Mike's ready** — event-score algo (§7), voice (§10), backup (§13), security (§14), admin (§16).

Async/external (don't block dev): IP lawyer, App Store video, biometric device test.
