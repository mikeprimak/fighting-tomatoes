Hello Claude. Please use all the information in this folder to develop context. You and I ae going to be working on developing this mobile app in this chat.

FightCrewApp - Combat Sports Rating App
I'm building a React Native + Node.js app called "FightCrewApp" - like Rotten Tomatoes but for rating combat sports fights (UFC, Bellator, etc.). The goal is to create an enterprise-ready app suitable for acquisition by larger companies like UFC/ESPN.
Current Tech Stack & Architecture
* Frontend: React Native (Expo), Expo Router, TypeScript, React Query
* Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
* Structure: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces (backend, mobile, shared packages)
* Auth: JWT with refresh tokens, SecureStore for mobile storage

-- fights --

Fights can:

- must involve two fighters
- are associated with one event, one promotion/organization and one date.

- can be tagged with various tags by users such as "Exciting", "Edge of your Seat" and "Crazy Knockdowns"...
- a ratings distribution chart can be shown for each fight, showing how many users rated it 10 vs 9 vs 8 ....
- before fights hapen, users can give them a score between 1 to 10 on how entertaining the user predicts the fight will be.

-- tags --

- when a user is rating or commenting on a fight, they can also select one or more from a list of tags to apply to that fight, such as "Fast Paced" "Quick KO" or "Back and forth"

- these tags can later be used to create lists like "best fights that are "fast Paced"





-- the site as a whole --

- the site as a whole must ba able to store some data and perform some analytics.
- for example, I will want to analyze the data and run recommendation engines on it to develop recommendations for users. i want the database to allow for a variety of different analysis and insight generation.
- the database should follow all current best practices.
