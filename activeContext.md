# Current Development Context

## What We're Working On
next steps

**Current Sprint**: auth and user creation
**Last Completed**: Shared TypeScript types across packages
**Next Immediate Steps**:
1. build postgres database
2. Build search API endpoints for fights/events...

## Recent Decisions Made
- Established comprehensive shared types for type safety
- Decided to use star rating system (1-10) for fights
- Chose React Query for client state management
- Using Expo managed workflow (ready to eject if needed)

## Current Blockers
- None at the moment

## Files Recently Modified
- packages/shared/src/types/* (all type definitions)
- packages/mobile/app/(tabs)/fights.tsx (rating modal)
- packages/backend/src/routes/* (API structure)

## Immediate Technical Debt
- Need input validation with Zod schemas
- Missing comprehensive error boundaries
- No offline support yet
- Limited test coverage

Database Layer - COMPLETED

✅ PostgreSQL database setup and configuration
✅ Prisma ORM integration with comprehensive schema
✅ UUID-based primary keys replacing email identification
✅ Proper foreign key relationships across all entities
✅ Comprehensive seed data including users, fighters, events, fights, ratings, reviews
✅ Gamification system with points, levels, and user activities
✅ Social features: follows, notifications, review voting
✅ Analytics foundation for recommendation engine

Current Database Architecture:

Single PostgreSQL database replacing multiple MySQL databases
20+ tables with proper relationships and constraints
Modern authentication structure supporting OAuth
Tag categorization system with rating-based display logic
Complete audit trail for user activities and gamification

Immediate Next Steps:

Implement JWT authentication endpoints
Create user registration with email verification
Build core API routes for fights, ratings, and reviews
Add middleware for authentication and validation
