# Current Development Context

## What We're Working On
database schema and creating database on local machine

**Current Sprint**: postgres database development
**Last Completed**: Shared TypeScript types across packages
**Next Immediate Steps**:
1. build postgres database
2. Build search API endpoints for fights/events...

## Recent Decisions Made
- Established comprehensive shared types for type safety
- Decided to use star rating system (1-10) for fights
- Chose React Query for client state management
- Using Expo managed workflow (ready to eject if needed)

## Current Blockers
- None at the moment

## Files Recently Modified
- packages/shared/src/types/* (all type definitions)
- packages/mobile/app/(tabs)/fights.tsx (rating modal)
- packages/backend/src/routes/* (API structure)

## Immediate Technical Debt
- Need input validation with Zod schemas
- Missing comprehensive error boundaries
- No offline support yet
- Limited test coverage
